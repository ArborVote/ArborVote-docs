The decision-making process in ArborVote takes place in three stages:

1. Debating
2. Voting
3. Counting

## Debating Stage
After the question/proposal/debate thesis was posted and a bounty was placed by an issuer,
the creation phase begins.
Participants joining the debate can post arguments for which they have to pay a fee.
